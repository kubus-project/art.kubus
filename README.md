## Overview

**art.kubus** is a research-driven, open-source platform that bridges the intersection of contemporary art, extended reality (XR), and blockchain technology. Developed as a comprehensive ecosystem for artists, institutions, and collectors, the platform leverages augmented reality (AR) and Web3 infrastructure to democratize access to art while fostering meaningful connections within the creative community.

The platform emerged from rigorous academic research exploring spatial computing, decentralized technologies, and contemporary art practices. By combining geospatial artwork discovery, immersive AR experiences, and blockchain-verified ownership, art.kubus creates an innovative framework for experiencing, collecting, and supporting digital and physical art in the 21st century.

### Key Features

- **Geospatial Art Discovery**: Interactive map-based exploration of art installations through location-aware AR markers
- **Augmented Reality Experiences**: Camera-based artwork scanning that unlocks immersive 3D content and contextual information
- **Web3 Integration**: Native KUB8 token for transactions, NFT minting and trading on the Solana blockchain
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven platform development through DAO voting mechanisms
- **Cross-Platform Access**: Consistent experiences across mobile devices, web browsers, and VR headsets
- **Artist-Centric Design**: Tools for portfolio management, artwork uploads, and direct collector engagement
- **Achievement System**: Gamified rewards through POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) tokens and collectibles
- **Institutional Partnerships**: Framework for galleries and museums to digitize exhibitions and extend reach

### Research Foundation

art.kubus represents the culmination of interdisciplinary research conducted during a Master's thesis, examining the convergence of digital art, spatial computing, and decentralized technologies. The platform's architecture is grounded in rigorous methodology, addressing contemporary challenges in art accessibility, digital ownership, and creator compensation. By implementing practice-based research principles, the project demonstrates how emerging technologies can serve as tools for social innovation and cultural democratization.

The platform's development prioritizes artist autonomy, community governance, and sustainable economic models that challenge traditional art market structures while maintaining respect for artistic integrity and intellectual property rights.

### Project Status

art.kubus is currently in active development, with a functional pre-alpha platform available at [https://art.kubus.site](https://art.kubus.site). The codebase is open source under the MIT License, welcoming contributions from developers, artists, and researchers interested in the intersection of art and technology.
